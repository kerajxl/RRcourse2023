## A summary of some basic statistics

```{r}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranczo_(TV_series)"
html <- read_html(url)
table <- html %>% html_nodes("table") %>% .[[14]] %>% html_table(fill = TRUE)
knitr::kable(table[,c(1:11)], "html", caption = "Ranch viewership per season and episode ")

```
## 4) A graph of the viewership over time.
```{r}
#/ warning = FALSE

  arrange(season) %>% 
  filter(Episode != 'Average viewing', !is.na(viewers)) %>% 
  mutate(season_episode = paste0( season,'_s_',Episode,"_e'")) %>%   select(season_episode, viewers)

```

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data = table_long, aes(x = season_episode, y = viewers)) +
  geom_point()+
